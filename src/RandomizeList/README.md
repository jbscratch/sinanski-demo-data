# Randomize list
For a list of random values it is nice not to have one value appear more than once next to each other.
Meaning it would be nice if no entry is repeated before the whole list was used.

## The code idea
- This would be much nicer to offer any type as an array here. But currently just not up for it.
- I should also offer the creation of a list of random numbers, not duplicating the last entry
- But this also sucks since it needs lots of handling of possible errors. So something for later.
